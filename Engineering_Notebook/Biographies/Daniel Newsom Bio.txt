Daniel Newsom - Biography


I'm Daniel Newsom. I lived in Tyler, TX but recently moved to Alamogordo NM. I go to school at the Imago Dei academy. I enjoy sketching, art, playing the guitar, and mocking children. I've graduated with outstanding honors in a prefreshman summer engineering course, and I've also competed in a regional science fair. I didn't win but that's beside the  point. I'm participating in FTC robotics this year because I've always planned to be an engineer and am fascinated by the advancements in robotics today. An interesting fact about me is that my hair is way cooler than yours lol. My favorite dessert is chocolate cream pie. If you or someone you know doesn't enjoy chocolate cream pie, please send any inquiries to me so I can beat you or your friend to a pulp. Sincerely, Ya Boi.
