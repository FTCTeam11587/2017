My name is Dale James and Alamogordo, New Mexico. I attend Imago Dei where I play cello, and do FTC. I enjoy going on mission trips, going to youth group, working out, and playing sports. I also sometimes help my dad build airplane wings. I enjoy FTC because I enjoy talking and public speaking which it allows me to do plenty. I workout a lot. My favorite dessert is Frozen yogurt.
