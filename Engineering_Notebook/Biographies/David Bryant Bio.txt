Imago dei Academy 

I enjoy videogames, eating, sleeping, and mainly indoor activities.
why robotics?
when our school first introduced the concept of FTC, I didn't really care about it at first, but when the school year went along, i saw that they were having more and more fun. So this year, i decided to join the FTC team. I wanted to join, mainly so I can have a better understanding of the computer programing that went behind the robot, also to maybe try to build a robot of my own.
