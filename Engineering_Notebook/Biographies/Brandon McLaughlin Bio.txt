BIOGRAPHY

Brandon McLaughlin
Alamogordo, New Mexico
Imago Dei Academy

I enjoy Hiking, Video games, and Cello
I have studied Anatomy, Physics, Chemistry, and Astronomy
Why robotics? A long time ago, i joined this school. I receiverd a lot of science study, and as I got older I realized that logic, binary code, and mathematics were some of my greatest skills. When the FTC came to our school I was interested and decided to give it a try. Soon a lot of friends were helping me with electrical engineering. So now I have a deep interest in robotics and hope to have a future in it.
I love James Bond, Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Sherlock Holmes.
