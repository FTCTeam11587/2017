Why Robotics?: I wasen't sure about it at first, but then I realized that the people here are nice (and i already knew a few) and it was cool to see something you just built, wired, and programmed come to life and be able to control it with a simple controller similar to that of a Xbox controller. Due to this i was already kinda decent at it.
